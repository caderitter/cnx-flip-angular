# cnx-flip-angular
Angular frontend for OpenStax Flip, a textbook-integrated flashcard application

# Requirements
The installation instructions for the following are easily found online.

[git](https://git-scm.com/) (PC users: make sure to install Git Bash)

[node >= v4.x.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) (PC users: make sure to install using Git Bash)

npm >= v3.x.x (installs with node)

# Setup
Mac: open Terminal

PC: open Git Bash (should have installed with your git installation)

Enter the following commands:

This "clones" this repository to a new directory `cnx-flip-angular`.

`git clone https://github.com/caderitter/cnx-flip-angular/ cnx-flip-angular`

This changes the current directory to the newly created directory.

`cd cnx-flip-angular`

This runs Node Package Manager's installation routine, installing all necessary dependencies for the project.

`npm install`

This runs the start routine (compiles the code and runs the local server)

`npm start`

A browser window will open automatically.

To end the server, type `CTRL + C` in terminal/Git Bash.

After setup you can run the server after using

`npm start`

when in the directory `cnx-flip-angular`.
